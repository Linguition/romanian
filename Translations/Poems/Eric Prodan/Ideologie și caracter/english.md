# Ideology and character

In dance my crimson bride plays hora in a field of gold,\
Her feet, soaked in blood, her head, pale, and crowned with laurels.

While on the black scene of the world, her thoughts she spills,\
They gleam of greatness, for she became a bride.

Alive and fragile her body is, attired in flowers of linen\
Overhead there are branches and on the head she bears thorns:

"Your pyre plays bones forevermore, while in veins, liquid fire.\
Your blood leaks in rows over skin, morbid body.

Play by jumping, throw yourself in the heavens, violet in a dreamlike dance\
She raves in my song, makes you void in darkness.

From the chaste of the mind, rip yourself apart, radiant\
And thus be like with nature and thought for centuries, bride."
