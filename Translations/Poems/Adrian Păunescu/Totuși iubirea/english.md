# Albeit, love

And albeit love exists\
And albeit curse exists\
I let, I let the world know\
I love, I have the courage, I fear.

And albeit it's a state of watch\
And albeit we die repeatedly\
And albeit I believe in couples\
And albeit something changed.

Neither am I pretentious to the world\
A bed, darkness and you\
We enter in love without a name\
Thrill like thunderbolt struck.

The engines of the world are off\
The networks of rails are down\
A large emptiness is on the stretch\
Wake them up with a kiss.

Now I declare you a goddess\
I myself feel (like a) god\
Carry the world on, woman,\
With children written to my name.

Outside darknesses swarm\
Here we are luminous\
Between them churches brawl\
Making for themselves the same reproach.

Both you and love exist\
And death exists in it\
I like it more when you're sad\
Sadness, as a matter of fact, is yours.

My knees bend (from underneath) me on the floors\
I tilt my head (up) towards the sky,\
You are in my powers\
Although inquisitions demand you.

Whatever I say ramble comes out,\
I return to the first syllable,\
I throw over you the forest:\
Adieu, that is: remain.

And albeit love exists\
And albeit curse exists\
I let, I let the world know\
I love, I have the courage, I fear.
