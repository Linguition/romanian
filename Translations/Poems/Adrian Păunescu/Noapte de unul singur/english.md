# Night of the one and only

I hear a piano in crystalline snow\
And I am not with you, oh, I am not with you,\
Chopin - a certain piano concert\
And the path is long and the night is big.\
Of winter I'm getting tired, of blubber you are,\
Love between us in a thousand of beds,\
And springly snowfall still tears\
The veil of the bride in late night.\
Oddities and beasts in night are heard\
And chimeras snow, and it snows with whisper,\
I miss, as I do my childhood,\
You, the one that was not meant to be.\
But if you would be suddenly with me\
Everything would be different and I wouldn't feel well,

There are fumes above houses, lovers are in houses,\
And the sky smells of smoke and sins.\
The pendulum like a deadly noose is ready,\
It moves as if my tie chokes me,\
I crawl on my elbows, I look for you on the pillow,\
And us that were saying that love is eternal.\
And, look, how quick it shows up and goes\
And the blood in in the wound is cold,\
I hear a piano, a Chopin from far away\
Who you can't reach, who I didn't reach.\
A mute pianist unwinds in the stars\
And hands of his beat my ribs,\
This much I would like: To see you one more time\
And this as our last reward.\
And when besides the fire that until now we had been connected next to\
In the room deep (in) the wooden house,\
It would be to see you for the last time\
I would put the piano to learn to die.\
Like now when you are gone far away\
A piano flumps through splintered logs\
And a reddened moon bleeds onto the poplars\
Whereas I with nothing cannot get closer to you anymore\
And I fall on my knees beside the fire that dies down\
And I want to ask him if there is still any escape\
And he replies to me in the form of a gleam through the door\
And in my hands leaves a hot ash.\
I would beg you back though I don't have who to beg\
And the rest is just Chopin and silence.
