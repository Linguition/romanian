# The secret

1. If I will not come tonight\
   Mother, do not lock the door\
   Tell father that I am at the gate\
   Or find, or find, or find something.

   Tonight mother the world is mine\
   A world of twenty years\
   Watch, mother, the dance and be quiet, don't ask:\
   It's very simple, it is my day.

2. Do not ask a single question\
   I've had enough of questions\
   May it stay unexplained\
   Whether my secret, or my secret, I don't share it with anyone.

   Tonight mother the world is mine\
   A world of twenty years\
   Watch, mother, the dance and be quiet, don't ask:\
   It's very simple, it is my night.

3. If midnight grabs me\
   And I, mother, haven't come\
   Leave the phone alone\
   For tonight, tonight, mother, I am not to be found.

   Tonight mother the world is mine\
   A world of 20 years\
   Watch, mother, the dance and be quiet, don't ask:\
   It's very simple, it is my night.
