# Alexander turning the water down

Under the Persian sky, Alexander the Great\
wandered through the desert, under the eaves of stone.\
When behold: soldiers were bringing astride\
bellows with water from valleys-deep.\
And one, guessing him his eyes ablaze,\
filled with liqueur a helmet and extended it.\
But asking him: - Whom do you bring this?...\
and the wished helmet barely touching,\
the soldiers responded in vast silence:\
– To our children we bring it, but drink!...\
And all watched him with sadness and full\
of an immense pain, assaulted by lights.\
Then, tired and thirsty, Alexander\
reverted his sight to around the desert.\
An immense sun, a fiery candelabrum,\
hurt the whiteness of the boiled zenith\
with a few hundred copper lamps,\
ascended by shields for a few miles.\
The air molten bubbled like a lava,\
sipped by evil gales with breath of ember\
under fluid helmets, stripped of glory,\
the soldiers ached of a bitter heat,\
holding, with rings and with buttons, in a cortege\
superb harnesses of flame on horses.\
[The] blaze shoot out from precipices and chains,\
from rocks and volcanos with rich deposits,\
of which oven with mineral treasures\
a shadow of fire threw onto the earth.\
The fine sand of this desert\
in the final thread was red and alive.\
Through luminous caves like in mystical tombs\
the soldiers died licked by the blaze,\
next to spears red like flares\
that until late watched over [the] valleys;\
but others, bitten by cruel burns,\
has fallen into narrow tents, into carriages.\
With the helmet in the mine, with dreamed water,\
he stood tumultuous [while] watching his sword.\
The soldiers shouted in droopy silence:\
– To our children we bring it, but drink!...\
And if we lose it in desolate areas,\
we will make home more brave children...\
Like so, raised from his saddle, in airs,\
seemed [to be] in the blaze a tortured god\
escaping a formless herd of spirits\
with water in hand and the helmet stolen.\
But he turned suddenly, and-then\
the treasure from the helmet he gave back.\
Then, the travelers shouted in crowds,\
and stones gleaming repeated:\
– From now on,\
we no longer know neither hunger, nor thirst\
and not even fatigue from the battle or road.\
And lead us, Master, from now on wherever you wish:\
in your presence we aren't people, but gods!\
