# To Marx

1.\
When I sleep in sad, forgotten petals, serenities,\
When the deaf convulsions make the world tremble, when the hours\
Run, whipped by news in wild uproar.\
When the thought goes for a walk-agitated and cannot fall asleep,\
When the calm is broken under boots and wails and dies,\
I think about the man with a forehead of a light white,\
With a huge and gray beard, cut in a curve\
Of the arc of the black moustache set downwards\
I think about the lucid, generous, populated\
By ideas that frantically agitate the tall banners,\
Just like for a century has ploughed itself cleanly\
His alive face in the bedrock of my memory.

2.\
I do not know how the poets can play with these\
Rhymes of our present and concrete living,\
Sadly, I observe him, (while) throwing my glances over\
My invisible epaulette\
Marx, I remember you even now.

You were capering about with the youngster on your back, and in your mind\
Thoughts at this time wandered into depths,\
To make more clear the light of an abyss.

Carrying my child in me in rhythms I romp him,\
Dizzying is the cadence, woven from flame,\
It awakens in me spinning, the boiling is deafened,\
It manages to get outside and this way strikes to hurt.

May it hurt this time consigning him, may it hurt, may it call\
The world at bells and at sins,\
May it call, may it hurt, may it call in repeated vibrations\
The world at acts and clarity.

3.\
Marx, I remember a dream of yours and mine.\
It will not sadden you when I will tell you that it is yours and mine.

You have dreamt that everyone has to say: it is yours and mine;\
Marx, I remember a dream of yours and mine.\
May it be sucked in by amazing flowers, the purities,\
May the thought jump in high, and may it at the halts fall asleep,\
May the pulse sound normal and may the hours slide In harmonious and limpid
uproar.
