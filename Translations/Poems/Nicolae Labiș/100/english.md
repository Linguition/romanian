In the city between mountains -\
Like ridged stalagmites -\
A year after war,\
The houses leered, hurt.

Autumn was making purple the mountains,\
Saps were freezing in plants,\
Frost fell at dawn\
Over dung, diamonds.

Twenty-three August\
Its first live remembrance\
It brought it between the poplars\
Great, of early autumn.

In the city between mountains,\
The people didn't understand\
How great that day is\
Enveloped in gray rain.

Through the mud on the streets\
Defiled no more than a hundred,\
Only a hundred men -\
Under the wind's scroll,\
The red flag danced\
Through the poor houses,\
The way large banners\
Of the armies' do.

At the windows were bowing\
The old women like in cemeteries,\
Others shook their heads\
As if from confusion,\
Others foresaw under-sky\
An unseen change,\
And through rain they defiled,\
The hundred, the hundred.

A hundred stride through ruins\
(Today there are parks and there are houses)\
A hundred stride, the dogs bark,\
(Today, noisy motors)\
A hundred stride, staggered,\
Drops of mud on the garment hang,\
A hundred stride, the clouds grow\
But under clouds there is light.

A hundred stride - eyes blazing,\
Blue lips shut,\
(Until today many fell,\
Either under rain, or under knives).\
A hundred stride on the asphalt -\
Whipped by wet branches -\
(Until today many grew,\
From those that have stayed at the windows).

In the city between mountains,\
Like water they climb in the sun\
The people on crooked streets,\
And into the banners the wind blows.\
Pulsating like a heart,\
In the loose crowd\
Striding they're heard sonorously\
The hundred, the hundred.
