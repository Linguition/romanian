# Death of the doe

Drought has snuffed out any gust of wind.\
The sun has melted and flowed onto the soil.\
The sky has remained boiling and empty.\
Buckets bring silt from the well.\
Fires, fires over woods still more often\
Dance, wild, satanic dances.

I follow my father on the hill through thorny bushes,\
And they claw at my arms, bad and dry.\
We begin the hunt for goats,\
The hunger's hunt in the Carpathian mountains.\
The thirst has crumbled me. Simmers on the stone\
The trickle of water (which) seeped from the spring.\
Temple slumps on shoulder. I step as if on a different\
Planet, immense, foreign and heavy.

We wait at this place where still are heard\
From the strings of mellow waves, streams.\
When the sun will set, when the moon will flicker,\
Here will gather in a row to quench their thirst\
The deer, one by one.

I tell my father that I'm thirsty and he signals to quieten.\
Amok water, how clearly you sway!\
I feel bound through thirst to the being which will die\
At the time forbidden by laws and custom.

With a withered rustle the valley wheezes.\
What a horrifying nightfall floats in the universe!\
Blood flows on the horizon and my chest is red, as if\
Hands full of blood on my chest I had wiped.

Like on an altar, bracken burns with purpur blazes,\
And the forgotten stars blinked between them.\
Woe, how I would like for you to not come anymore, not come anymore,\
Beautiful sacrifice of my forest!

She showed up leaping and stops herself\
Looking around with a kind of fear,\
And her narrow nostrils frightened the water\
With slippery circles (made) of copper.

In her wet eyes glazed something unclear,\
I knew that she will die and it will hurt her.\
It seemed to me that I am reliving a myth\
With the girl turned into a doe.\
From above, palid, lunar light\
Was sifting over her warm fur the dark cherry blossoms.\
Woe, how I wished that for the first time\
The barrel of father's rifle may miss!

But the valleys bellowed. Fallen on (her) knees,\
She had raised her head, dragged it towards the stars,\
She toppled it over then, induced onto the runaway water\
Black swarms of pearls.\
A blue bird jolted between the branches,\
And the deer's life towards the late horizons\
Flying smoothly, with cry, like the birds in autumn\
When they leave gray, empty nests.\
Wobbly, I went and I shut her\
Obscure eyes, sadly guarded by antlers,\
And I quivered silent and pale when father\
Hissed with pleasure: - We have meat!

I tell my father that I am thirsty and he signals to drink.\
Dizzy water, how dark you sway!\
I feel bound through thirst to the being that has died\
At the time forbidden by laws and custom.\
But the law is vain to us and foreign\
When life inside us with difficulty still holds grip,\
And the custom and mercy are empty\
When my sister is starving, ill and deathly.

On a nostril father's rifle urges smoke.\
Woe, without wind the leaves are running!\
Father arouses the horrifying flame.\
Woe, how much the forest has changed!\
From the grass I grasp in my hands without knowing\
A little bell with a silver tongue...\
From the skewer father takes in his fingertips\
The heart of the doe and the kidneys.

What is heart? I am hungry! I want to live, and I would like...\
You, forgive me, little girl - you, my doe!\
I am sleepy. How tall is the flame! And the wood, how deep!\
I am crying. What does dad think? I am eating and crying. I am eating!
