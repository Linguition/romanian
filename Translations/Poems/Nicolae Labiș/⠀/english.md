The bird with the beak of ruby\
Has taken revenge - behold! - it has taken revenge.\
I'm not able to caress it anymore.

It crushed me,\
The bird with the beak of ruby,\
And tomorrow\
The chicks of the bird with the beak of ruby,\
Pecking through the dirt,\
Perhaps will find\
Traces of the poet Nicolae Labiș\
Which will remain a beautiful memory...
