# Mama

I haven't passed through the village in a long time and tells me\
A man that stepped outside his house\
How our bird cherry had bloomed\
And that you've turned pale, boy, you've turned pale.

Another man told me that you stayed in bed, ill.\
I don't know how to believe this many news,\
When from the letters I see how lady\
Day after day you always become younger.
