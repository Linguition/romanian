# Eulogy

Poor, powerless,\
In the world I'm fated\
Through the valleys of pain\
To go endlessly

I have a soul... But it sighs\
Through it I always pass,\
Like through the veins passes\
The death's hard chill;

For he if he loves\
A sweet water lily,\
His love ensconces itself\
From a bitter disdain!

In vain I want through love\
To make myself happy:\
Ho! There is no happiness\
Here for the poor man!...

I didn't have a calm day\
In which to live;\
My life declines today,\
Like a flower I wilt!

My pain is great,\
Profound is mine longing!...\
O! Bitter tears,\
Hurry! For I wish to die!...
