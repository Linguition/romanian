# When Ștefan was to die

I

When Ștefan was to die,\
There was much grief in the country:\
How many arms in despair\
Weren't risen towards the heaven?

How many sacrifices at the altars\
How much myrrh and incense\
So that the swift Ștefan\
Alive and sound would remain!

It seemed that not even the soil\
Couldn't bear to receive him,\
The one which has been too worthy\
To rule over everything.

And of horror and pain\
The earth trembled,\
Like in the day of the crucifixion\
Of the one that proclaimed the word...

When Ștefan was to die,\
There was much grief in the country:\
Who would be able to say\
How many hearts bled?

Winter difficult like never\
And complete starvation\
Swept that year\
Over his beloved country.

Though not even on the deathbed\
He couldn't allow forgotten\
That which had been rightly\
Proclaimed: The country's parent...

Beside his bed calling him,\
He caresses all the penniless,\
They cry and kiss his hand\
The widows and the orphans.

They cry and bless him,\
And return to the fireplaces,\
While the boyars day and night\
Stay at his bed of agonies...

III

When Ștefan was to die,\
There was much grief in the country:\
At his bed of agonies\
All the boyars gathered.

At the veranda begging to take him,\
He took the glass in his hands,\
So that he may search once more\
For his Moldova — the poor one!

And because of what he saw within though\
A thrill encompassed him firstly —\
In the bewitched glass\
He had read the future!

Ages darkened by wrath,\
And by battles, and by grief,\
Have shown up, suddenly,\
Smiting his views...

So does the dream exist, or is it [even] alive?\
From Olt, rising, seeing\
A lofty vulture that stretches\
Its wings - and adumbrates

The Entire Muntenian Country\
And Moldova and Ardeal...\
Woe! but night even blinder\
Throws behind itself the wave!

Suddenly, without a warning,\
His face becomes serene\
Heavy fog opens once again\
Blue eyelashes of light.

On the Dunarean field\
He sees Romanian armies in the horizon;\
Brave prince from foreign countries\
He goes afront them astraddle...

Songs of victory\
Grow and fill the air entirely -\
And smiling with his soul content,\
Leader Ștefan has given up the ghost!...

V

But with the knell full of grief\
Thousands of bells announce:\
"Ștefan the leader of Moldova,\
Ștefan the leader is no more!"

Sad is the monastery of Putna,\
The open gates await\
The glowing convoy which comes\
And towards them approaches slowly.

It's Ștefan. Today he crosses\
The latter journey through the country,\
But there where he steps now,\
On a great day of summer,

The hill cries, the valley cries,\
The elder forests cry,\
And the nation in racket cries:\
"In whose hands do you leave us, master?"

Epilogue

Four centuries of pain\
Have passed - And in deep night\
Ștefan sleeps, but even today\
The entire country mourns him still.

And the woods will mourn him for ages\
Teeming mournfully from the branches,\
As long as we will remain inside our boundaries\
Still helots of other countries!

Rings will mourn him deplorably;\
And vain, a long time,\
from the abyss of lost valleys,\
Sad alphenhorns will call him...

Though when the clock will sound\
Of justice for the country,\
From his grave will emerge\
The point of the sword of flame...

And there will be a great war\
Between all nations;\
Horses, in a flood of blood,\
Until the crests will drown...

Over us all then will glide\
The soul of Ștefan the Great -\
And we will break any chains,\
We will crush any limits!
