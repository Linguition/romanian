# The country's emblem

Like a provoked bison\
When it caught dirt in its horns,\
Everything that stood in his way\
Ready to overturn\
Like a provoked bison\
Moldovans have battled\
With the deluge of pagans.

Like a lion that tears apart\
When caught by bowmen he sees himself,\
Through the crowd for the people\
He thunderously charges\
Like a lion that tears apart\
Oltenians jump in their mountains\
In a hell of Latins.

And Muntenians that have had\
A nest on the waters of Dâmbovița,\
Like the vulture in mountains nurtured\
Protecting the kidnapped\
Their vulture chicks have made a shield\
To their country they've deviated\
The black cloud of hordes

Bison and vulture and lion\
I was when the heathen has trampled\
My fatherland and my right.\
And will be the Romanian\
And from now Romanian forever,\
Bison and vulture and lion\
And the brave of the world.
