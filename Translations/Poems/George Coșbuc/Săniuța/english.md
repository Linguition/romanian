# The little sleigh

Snow over all has fallen,\
Came the dear winter,\
Come, children, onto the hill upwards\
To sledge with the sleigh.\
And a one! And a two!\
We climb in the little sledge;\
Without horses and without oxes\
The little sledge flees, flies.\
Everyone is blushed on their cheek,\
Many get off, many get up,\
Ones laugh, make great humour,\
Others get bumps.
