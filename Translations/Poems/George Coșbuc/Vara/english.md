# Summer

I was looking up aimlessly 窶能
With a wild splendour\
I saw Ceahlﾄブ at sunset,\
Far in the streaks gone yellow,\
A giant with its face in the sun,\
Stationed in our country's watchtower.\
And alike a secret traveller,\
A cloud with the mountain neighbouring\
Was floating in this immense clearing\
And didn't have wings to fly anymore!\
And the air was full\
Of chirped songs.

The glances drunk with glamour\
I returned down unto the ground 窶能
While the lavenders were playing in the wind,\
Like in hora after a jovial sing\
The children with blonde braids,\
When their long vestments jumped.\
In January there were lads and lasses,\
And they sung a doina as a choir.\
Life played in their eyes\
And the wind fiddled through braids.\
White lambs ran towards the stream\
And ashy starlings flew in hordes

How beautifully you have formed,\
Nature, You! Like a virgin\
With dear path, with lovely face!\
I would cry of happiness,\
That I feel your divine spirit,\
That I can see what you have conjured!\
My heart is full of tears,\
That in it were always buried\
Mine, and I will bury myself as well!\
O she's great, but greatly soft 窶能
Nature, in my grave,\
Everything is warm, because it is light!
