# Unfit for debt

She comes down from the mill;\
On the little road\
Setting her sack down, pity\
She cannot lift it.\
– "I will carry it for you!" – "How?" – "For a price!"\
While she, a sensible girl,\
Agrees immediately.\
Why, after all, would she object?

I get on my way with the sack on my back.\
At the path half\
I ask for the payment, three kisses.\
But look, her manner:\
She stays on the path and weighs the options\
And tells me everything but all:\
That I'm costly, that she cannot,\
That three are too many!

To two she agrees,\
Though one she pays me,\
With the other she will remain to me\
A serial debtor.\
But I will not see it ever!\
And watch me, the pitiful,\
Carrying foolishly the sack\
For a single kiss!
