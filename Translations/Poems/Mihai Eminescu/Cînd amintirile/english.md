# When the memories

When the memories in the past\
Attempt to summon me,\
On the long and known path\
I still step from time to time.

Above your house pass\
Even today the same stars,\
That have illuminated so often\
My touchiness.

And over the fanned out trees\
The gentle moon rises,\
Which was finding us embraced\
Whispering to ourselves.

Hearts of ours promised to each other\
Loyalty for all centuries,\
When on sidewalks were shaking themselves off\
Of the flower the lilacs.

Could this much longing really\
Have been extinguished during the night,\
When the ripples of the stream\
Have not ceased to cry?

Then the moon moves through the oaks\
Always following its footsteps,\
When your eyes, still but large,\
Are gazing sweetly and wistfully.
