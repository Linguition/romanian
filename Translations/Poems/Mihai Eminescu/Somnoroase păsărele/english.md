# The sleepy birds

The sleepy birds\
On nests they gather,\
They hide in the branches -\
Goodnight!

Only the streams sigh,\
While the black wood quietens;\
Even the flowers sleep in the garden -\
Sleep peacefully!

The swan swims in the water\
Through the reeds to lay to sleep -\
May the angels be near you,\
Sweet dreams!

Over the prairies of night\
Rises the proud moon,\
Everything is a dream and harmony -\
Goodnight!
