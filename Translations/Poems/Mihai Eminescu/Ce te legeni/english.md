# Why do you rock...

-- Why do you rock, thick wood,\
Without rain, without wind,\
With branches [laid] on the ground?\
-- Why would I not rock,\
When my time runs out!\
The day falls, the night grows\
And my leaf it thins.\
The wind blows my leaf into stripes –\
The singers it chases them away;\
The wind blows from a direction –\
Winter's here, summer's far.\
And why should I not leave,\
When the birds run!\
Over the peak of branches,\
Swallows pass in flocks,\
Carrying my thoughts\
And my luck with themselves.\
And they go one by one, one by one,\
Darkening the horizon of light,\
And they pass like moments,\
Shaking [their] wings,\
And they leave me desolate,\
Withered and numb\
And alone with my longing,\
To the point that it is the only thing I associate with!
