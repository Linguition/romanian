# If the years are to pass...

If the years are to pass as they did,\
I will like her [even] more,\
Because in her entire being\
It is an 'I don't know how' and 'I don't know what'.

She enchanted me with but a spark\
From the moment we saw each other\
Though she isn't but a woman,\
Albeit, it's different, 'I don't know how'.

That's why it's all the same to me\
If she were to speak, or to be quiet:\
If her voice is harmony,\
Even in silence it's an 'I don't know what'.

Therefore enslaved by these griefs\
I always course on the same road...\
In the quiet of her spells\
It's an 'I don't know what' and an 'I don't know how'.
