# When the voice itself

When the voice of thoughts itself shuts up,\
The voice of a sweet piety imitates me –\
Then I call you; Will you hearken to my summon?\
From the thick cold fogs, sailing, will you untangle yourself?

The power of night will you gently calm,\
With large eyes and bearers of peace?\
Rise hither from the shadow of times\
To see you coming – as if in a dream, like that you approach!

You come down slowly ... close, closer,\
Lean over, while smiling over mine face,\
Your love, with a sigh, I show it,

With your eyelash touch me on my eyelids\
To feel the thrill of squeeze in arms –\
For ages lost, for ages adored!
