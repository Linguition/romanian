# Letter from Basarabia

With my crooked and brash talk\
I know that I've hurt you [by] saying\
That you took both my speech and bread\
And [that] you've rushed onto my land.

In the putrid and empty time\
To me, brother, how should I say,\
To me they've lied at school\
That you're an enemy to me, not a good brother.

From Bessarabia I write to you,\
Sweet brothers from across the Prut.\
I'm writing to you how I can and very late,\
I'm missing you and I send you kisses.

I believed plague is fortune,\
A blessing that deformed the way of speech.\
I read Arghezi today, Blaga -\
God, How horribly God I've been lied to!

With unending repentance\
I pray to the beloved Jesus\
May he forgive my stray word\
That about you, brother, I have said.

From Bessarabia I write to you,\
Sweet brothers from across the Prut.\
I'm writing to you how I can and very late,\
I'm missing you and I send you kisses.

Finding that you're a brother to me, once\
I shed a tear from my eyes\
Which at once was arrested too\
And sent to the prison in Siberia.

There on the frigid horizon,\
From the mute lump of salt of the tear\
The miners dig out even today the salt\
And do not reach its end.

From Bessarabia I write to you,\
Sweet brothers from across the Prut.\
I'm writing to you how I can and very late,\
I'm missing you and I send you kisses.
