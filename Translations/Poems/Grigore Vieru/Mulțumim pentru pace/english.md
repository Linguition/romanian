# We're thankful for peace

Mum bakes white bread\
We caper cheerfully,\
For peace, for peace\
We're very thankful.

Dad whistles [for us to come],\
We sing mournfully.\
For peace, for peace\
We're very thankful.

Trees bloom around [us],\
The sky is luminous.\
For peace, for peace\
We're very thankful.
