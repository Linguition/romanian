# The tatar

Hey Tatar, hold you horse,\
Hey Tatar, squeeze his bridle,\
Hey Tatar, leave the shore,\
Don't attempt to cross the river,\
That, on the cross of the holy law!\
Of you two, over the coast,\
Nothing, really, he wouldn't decide\
Hey Tatar, hey Tatar!

Hey Tatar, give us peace,\
Hey Tatar, wait, don't cross,\
Hey Tatar, do not make me\
Smash your head into ten!\
That from above, from the mound,\
If I would swing the mighty club,\
Woe, I would only cry for you in mercy,\
Hey Tatar, hey Tatar!

Hey Tatar, – where is your broadsword?\
Hey Tatar, – where is your horse?\
Hey Tatar, – where is your glory?\
Haven't I warned not to cross the shore?\
You didn't know, neighbour,\
How the Romanian is in rage?\
Ravens bite from you now,\
Hey Tatar, hey Tatar!
