# Anthem to Stephen the Great

At the footsteps of the Carpathians,\
Under your ancient grave,\
Sleep, hero of Romanians,\
O! Stephen, holy hero!\
Alike the striking sentinels\
The Carpathians guard you\
And of your sublime glory\
For centuries they whisper.

When the nations trembled\
Under the fierce pagans,\
You were defending them with arms\
Of the valorous Romanians.\
With love watching your fatherland\
And the death with contempt,\
Great in bosom of battles,\
And in peace you have been great.

In the sky the sun sets\
Smothering its rays,\
But in the souls of ours\
For ages you do not dout!\
Through the fog of the past,\
O! Victorious sun!\
Light with splendid rays,\
Present and past.

In the time of valour,\
Made up of a sacred wish,\
You dreamt of the unification of Dacia\
With a flock and a shepherd;\
O! Great heroic shadow,\
Regarding your dream:\
United we are in thought,\
United in God.

At the footsteps of the Carpathians,\
At your ancient grave,\
All on their knees, o! Stephen,\
We submit an oath:\
To have a thought in the name\
Of the Romanian nation,\
Blazing with the love of glory\
And of the fatherland!
