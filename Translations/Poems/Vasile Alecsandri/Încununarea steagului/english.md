# The flag's coronation

The church is full of bowed heads.\
The kneeling mass listens, mourning\
The grieving death list of unforgotten names\
Of those dead in flowers, defending the flag.

In front of a celebration a King and a Queen,\
And a flag which is raised, shadowing the holy altar.\
It has many patches, but all are bowing to it\
For it is a relic, the Fatherland's garment.

O! Glorious patches, victory in battle\
You let yourselves (be) bitten and demand kisses!\
O! Romania's clothing, that many rips\
Contain the whole poem of her indomitability.

O! Flag, be for ages great together with the King,\
You the Star of Romania victoriously you bear it\
Be happy, today the Queen crowns herself\
With roses for the alive, with laurels for the dead.
