# Verses written on a wall

Soul alike the wind of death on my sweet spring\
And the flower of my life shortly has withered!\
The pain is more crude and grief more sour\
When you feel that you die far from what you've loved!

Slowly, slowly, feeling in me goes numb.\
A black cloud from above me still comes and again goes.\
My mind is troubled, my spirit weakens,\
On my heart is put a cold weight.

O! Country's souvenir! Heavenly caressing!\
Chase away to distance the dreadful black cloud,\
To see the light again, to feel revival,\
To sing beloved country, thereafter cheerful to die.
