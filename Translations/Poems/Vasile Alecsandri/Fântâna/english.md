# The fountain

On the flowered path which leads to the fountain,\
In a towel and an apron, walks a spry Romanian;\
She on the girdle wears a fork and on her breast an infant,\
With his little mouth sticky from the stream of milk.

The wife steps quickly, spinning the wool from the tow\
And twisting the reeling spindle that touches her on the feet.\
The birds fly around cheerfully and singing,\
She smiles and still walks, her baby jumping.

Behold, â€“ she gets to the fountain, and there she meets\
With a wayfarer from the entire world, who gazes at her,\
Then lowers the balance, then takes it out onto sunlight\
And hands his neighbour a pitcher, white, full.

The Romanian woman thanks (him), blows slowly over the pitcher\
And with the unused water wets her reddened face;\
While the wayfarer after her, waters his horse\
And curses that water isn't that sweet in the world.
