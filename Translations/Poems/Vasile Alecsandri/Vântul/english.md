# The wind

The wind is a frisky child, without mercy, no reprimand,\
Which shoves all the vassals on-sea into storm,\
And, like a wolf after herds, it chases away clouds,\
And topples down proud oaks and wilts flowers.

The wind steals a spark and in rows throws it,\
Watching how the harvest of an entire year of work is lost,\
Then goes to the children who pick a laurel of linen\
And laughing untangles them, musking their white chest.

And in all four parts of the world the rabid wind goes,\
Like the heathen onto graves overturning the Christian cross,\
And having farred the windmills' sins, he runs away, maniac\
Through the pricking bushes and the twigs of hazelnut.

But when he returns to the woods, his mother that wails\
For entire days, bathes him in milk and of wounds heals him...\
â€“ "Don't cry anymore, mummy! says he, like a saint,\
When I kiss their merry eyes, girls let themselves into the wind!"
