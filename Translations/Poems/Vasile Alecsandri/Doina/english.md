# Doina

Doina, little doina!\
If [only] I had a little chick\
With yellow flowers in the tress,\
With red flowers on the mouth!

If [only] I had a beautiful girl\
With little eyes of dove\
And with spirit of a fighter!

If [only] I had a blondie\
Tall, cheerful, light,\
Like a fawn!

I would make myself into a nightingale\
And I would sing at night in the cold\
The endearing Doina!

-

Doina, little Doina!\
If [only] I had a rifle\
And three bullets in the sack\
And a sister of a hatchet!

If [only] I had, on my mind,\
A horse quick as a lion,\
Black as a heavy sin!

If [only] I had some seven brothers,\
Each as manly as me\
And riding dragons!

I would make myself a big vulture,\
And I would sing during the day, at the sun,\
The spiteful Doina!

-

Doina, little Doina!\
And I would tell her: „Beautiful girl,\
I swear on this cross,\
To keep you like a dear!“

And I would tell it: „Warrior,\
May you return with the swallows\
Over the hills and valleys!“

And I would tell them: „Seven brothers,\
Make crosses and swear\
Live for ages and don't get caught alive!“

Come, kids, bravely,\
Let's save the poor country\
From the heathen and the slavery!
