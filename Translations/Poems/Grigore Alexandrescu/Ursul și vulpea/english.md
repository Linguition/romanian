# The bear and the fox

"So well the errands will run in the forest,\
For King Tiger when we will overthrow him\
And we will govern,\
The bear was saying to a fox, that anyone will swear\
That never took place\
A happier time."\
— "And in what will lie, really,\
Such great good?"\
Asks him. - "In everything\
Chiefly in righteousness:\
We will eradicate the abuse, the banditry,\
And we will make better the criminal law;\
For the tiger firstly tries the guilty\
And then strangles them."\
— "And you, what will you do to them?"\
— "We will eradicate them\
And then we will try them."

So on or so on,\
Which feel in state\
to govern the world,\
If out of the sky\
They would make an attempt,\
Everything like so would follow.
