# Grass

June is\
A green story.\
Impetuously it grows.\
The grass still grows.

The sixth day,\
The Saturday of grass.\
The silk still grows,\
The stags do not step on it.

Of the grass\
The threads grow\
Until at the height\
Of our heart.

This is the measure,\
The nature puts\
The margins of meadows,\
Laws in weeds.

Rainbows come\
To drink dew,\
The sap of life\
And of morning.

The powder from ears of wheat,\
Live's sentry,\
Lingers like a spell\
To destroy death.

The weather welcomes\
Hearts, grasses.\
Even the stags bellow!\
Wait and see [for yourself]!

How many\
Faces in the world\
Has and shows\
The grass with grace:

Sweet and beautiful\
Lines of thighs,\
Lines of girls,\
The mind may get drunk.

Girls how easily -\
Bodies and ankles -\
You resemble grasses.\
They are no longer people.
