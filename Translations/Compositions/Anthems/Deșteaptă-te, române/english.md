# Awaken thee, Romanian!

Awaken thee, Romanian, from the sleep of death,\
In which the barbaric tyrants have sunken you!\
Now or never carve yourself a different fate,\
At which will bow even your cruel enemies.

Now or never we will prove to the world\
That in these arms still flows the blood of a Roman,\
And that in chests of ours we keep with pride a name\
Triumphant in battle, the name of Traian!

Raise your broad forehead and search around you,\
How like fir trees in the mountains stand hundreds of thousands of strong men;\
A voice they still await and jump like wolves in pens,\
Old men, men, lads, youngsters, from the mountains and from the fields!

Look, great shadows, Michael, Stephen, Corvinus\
The Romanian nation, your great-grandsons,\
With weapons in their arms, with your fire in their veins,\
"Life is freedom or death" shout all.

You were annihilated by the evil of grudge\
And by your blind disunity at Milcov and the Carpathians\
While we, with souls pervaded by holy liberty,\
We swear that to lend a hand, to be forever brothers.

A mother, widowed, from the time of Michael the Great\
Claims from her sons today the hand of help,\
And curses with tears in her eyes on whomever,\
That in such a peril as this would become a traitor.

Of fire they should perish, of thunderbolt and brimstone,\
The ones that would withdraw from the glorious reign,\
When the fatherland or mother, with a mournful heart,\
Will demand us to step through sword and fire!

The scimitar of the barbaric crescent wasn't enough,\
Whose fatal plagues even today we feel;\
Today the stick is introduced in the ancient hearth,\
But witness to us is God that alive we do not accept!

The despotism with its whole blindness wasn't enough,\
Of which the yoke of centuries like cattle we wear;\
Now cruelties are tried, in the blind conceit of theirs,\
To steal our tongue, but only dead we will conceive it!

Romanians from four corners [of the world], now or never\
Unite yourselves in thought, unite yourselves in feeling!\
Shout to the wide world that the Danube is stolen\
Through intrigue and loathing, cunning conspiring!

Priests, with the cross in front, for the army is Christian,\
Its motto liberty and its objective most holy.\
We better die in battle, with glory fulfilled,\
Than be slaves again on our ancient soil.
