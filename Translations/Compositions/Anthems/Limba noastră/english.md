# Our language

Our language is a treasure\
In the depths buried\
A strand of precious stone\
Spilled over the ancient land.\
Our language is fire that burns\
In a nation, that without notice\
Has awoken from the deathly sleep\
Like the swift one in tales.\
Our language is only a song,\
A doina of our longings,\
A swarm of lightning, which rip\
The black clouds, white horizons.

Our language is the language of bread,\
Which moves because of wind in summer;\
Through its pronunciation the elders\
With sweat have blessed the country.\
Our language is a green leaf,\
The torment from eternal woods,\
The thin Dniester, which loses in the waves\
The candlesticks of stars.\
You will not cry then bitterly,\
As alive is the language too poor,\
And you will see, how generous is\
The speech of our dear country.

Our language is an ancient origin.\
Tales from other times;\
And reading them strung, -\
You are moved deeply and tremble.\
Our language is chosen\
To lift glories into heaven,\
To tell us in church and at home\
The eternal truths.\
Our language is a holy language\
The language of the cauldrons of ages,\
Which they weep and which they sing\
At their homestead, the countrymen

Resurrect now the language,\
Rusted for a long time\
Wipe the grime, the mold\
Of the limbo in which it sleeps.\
Gather the shining stone\
Which from the sun catches fire -\
And you will have in overflow\
A new flood of words.\
A treasure will rise swiftly\
In the depths buried,\
A strand of precious stone\
Spilled over the ancient land.
