# Falcon in the sky

Grey, proud, like a silent harbinger, old guardian of the northern land\
With smooth wing, beak of steel, crosses the horizon a falcon in the sky.\
From above it watches over the boundlessness, horizons unpervaded by man\
In the clouds it lingers, storm or sun, while its eyes see hidden secrets.

How many years have passed and how many are still to drain over the lands of
spells and of dream\
The green earth today was sprinkled with blood, blotched by our grandfathers,
for fatherland they have slain.

Falcon in the sky, winged brother, take my memory far away\
So that I may not die ever\
Provided that those that have known me, in their hearts would not forget me\
A falcon I will be too, with you I will fly.

Autumn flows more coldly now, sunsets are longer yet and sad\
In chimneys puffs of smoke rise, throughout valleys trees fall under sharp
hatchets\
Felt is the cold of winter which comes when the wood seems dead and frozen\
A falcon is in the sky, or maybe it is I, a guard under the clouds, by clouds
worn.

Falcon in the sky, winged brother, take my memory far away\
So that I may not die ever\
Provided that those that have known me, in their hearts would not forget me\
A falcon I will be too, with you I will fly.
