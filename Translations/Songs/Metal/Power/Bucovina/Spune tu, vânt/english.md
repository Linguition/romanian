# Say you, wind

Say you, frozen wind, where you have been, where you have stepped\
Through naked forests, on mountains and on valleys, frozen streams under
frenzied floes

If you have seen where you've passed, deep marks, dug into stones\
On wintery crests in mirrored waters, trails untravelled to lead far.

How you fly like the thought and you conjure up the earth, and you pass over
seas, deserts and dawns\
Do you not find perished, my blackened longing, with the longing in mind I will
not [be able to] find [myself] a grave.

Say you, frozen wind, where you have been, where you have stepped\
Through naked forests, on mountains and on valleys, frozen streams under
frenzied floes

May you search ceaselessly far and wide, from dawn to dusk, here and yonder\
In sun and in stars, in good [times] and bad [ones], may you not rest, may you
not linger.

Say you, frozen wind, where you have been, where you have stepped\
[And] if you have found my blackened longing, with it [still] in mind, I won't
find [myself] a grave.
