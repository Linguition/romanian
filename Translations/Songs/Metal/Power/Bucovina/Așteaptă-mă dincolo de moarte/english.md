# Await me from beyond death

[Verse 1]\
Autumn's cold showers\
Flow now with mourning\
Like a Styx\
Stunned by grief

Charon and his oars tremble\
And he doesn't want to move the rowboat\
So that the may not provide you, falcon\
Towards the depths a clear path

[Chorus]\
I'm on my way now\
On your sorrowful path\
Towards the chagrined realm\
Await me from beyond death!\
x2

[Verse 2]\
Storms would want to lead you back\
From your solemn path\
While mountains would gladly place themselves\
[As] dams on your path

Knowing that everything is futile\
But not wanting to see you again\
Even time to death an obstacle\
Would put itself if it could

[Chorus]\
I'm on my way now\
On your sorrowful path\
Towards the chagrined realm\
Await me from beyond death!\
x2

[Verse 3]\
Handkerchiefs didn't wave\
And nobody bid farewell\
Goodbye kisses\
On the forehead haven't lingered

Only a shadow which envelops autumn\
Has sown in hearts cold\
And on the road towards the fogs\
You set off

[Chorus]\
I'm on my way now\
On your sorrowful path\
Towards the chagrined realm\
Await me from beyond death!\
x2
