# My fearsome people

Until dark thoughts press me\
And throw me into heavy ardour,\
I think of what had been

While my ancestors come close\
And show me that in life,\
Albeit, I still have a purpose.

To build from the old ruins,\
From the ash of ages,\
From the faraway past

The new shield and strong sword,\
Eyes steeled and ardent,\
As well as the arm not fearful.

Shadows jump to my help\
And from a child-crumb,\
Now I grow [into] a wizard.

With but a short word,\
With the hand towards the sky,\
[I wake up from the dead](#reference-to-the-romanian-anthem)\
My fearsome people.

Over Bucovina as a whole\
Blows now a new call\
Under the banner with the wolf.

Before the tight army,\
Unvanquished forever,\
There will be a need for me to fight.

And if I am to fall slain,\
My soul will endure\
In any warrior dream.

With but a short word,\
With the hand towards the sky,\
[I wake up from the dead](#reference-to-the-romanian-anthem)\
My fearsome people.

# Notes and explanations

- ## Reference to the Romanian anthem

  The first line of the Romanian anthem reads:

  - Deșteaptă-te române, din somnul cel de moarte

  Which translates to:

  - Awaken thee, Romanian, from the deathly sleep

  The words 'Scol din morți strașnic neamul meu' reference this first line, by
  suggesting the character in the song is 'awaking' the Romanian nation from the
  'dead', as the anthem guides it to do.
