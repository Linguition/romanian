# The country from beyond the peaks of firs

A dream from the times bygone\
Which I didn't dare to dream,\
Follows me and steals my heart.

It's the country from beyond the peaks of firs,\
The sweet Bucovina,\
My ancient people and my blood.

Many have tried\
To keep it;\
Its chilly draft frightens their hearts.

Nobody can hearken\
The song of the creeks\
Which fall from the mountain, and that of the woods.
