# Sentry

The cuckoo sounds out, blame him\
So much so that Bucovina echoes\
The cuckoo sounds out, blame him\
So much so that Bucovina echoes.

The cuckoo sounds out in a fir tree\
So much so that it echoes in Cernăuți\
The cuckoo sounds out in Cernăuți\
So much so that it is heard in Rădăuți.

Bucovina, flower field\
Where are your sons?\
Bucovina, flower field\
Where are your sons?.

They were led into another country\
But will come back in spring.\
And back when they shall come\
Still they will love you.

To the mountains with scarce ridge\
Do not leave the sentry to perish.\
To the mountains with scarce ridge\
Do not leave the sentry to perish.

If your sentry is to perish\
Our country will also perish.\
If your sentry lives\
Our country will also live.
