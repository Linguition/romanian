# The Moon over the peaks

Over the peaks the Moon passes and hides herself [at times] in a cloud,\
She hugs me coldly and flees with my longing.

Below the branches of firs, under the woods, on the paths\
The Moon and her white rays make ghosts and apparitions.

Only one is the dearest, after whom I run until at dawn\
When I will catch her I will smother her in my arms, the Moon flees again into
the clouds.

Weary of the [constant] flight, I seek rest on a boulder,\
Yet the Moon reappears - a firefly around me a swarm.

Mine wings I suddenly put on and with fire I jump up towards the stars\
To catch the cold Moon in her flight, to catch my dear stars.

Over the peaks the Moon passes and hides herself [at times] in a cloud,\
She hugs me coldly and flees with my longing.
