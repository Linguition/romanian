# Under the lady's rock

[Oh] how much longer I would sit under your shadow, great wood,\
Your foliage would cradle me, from the lofty mountain;\
Cold creeks would hum to me, until I would be able to listen to\
Stories which over the world would spread, from times bygone.

Hidden paths I will seek, with stars [my] guide\
Nobody, [it doesn't matter] if they're man or beast, may they not hear me;\
[A] secret haven I will uncover, [well] hidden under The Lady's Rock,\
From this world I will depart, into autumn's immortality.
