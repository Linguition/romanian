# There are mountains and forests

Wind begins to blow from the north,\
While the sky changes its colour.\
Even the horizon doesn't exist anymore,\
While I [myself] am just a shadow.

The borders of this covert realm\
Aren't obstacles for me.\
The desert frozen in fog and in wind,\
Is my palace of mist and sadness.

Centuries have drained of the voievods,\
While their country is just opinion to them.\
From my thoughts arise other valiant [men]\
Who might too have a cruel reputation.

The saber shines and breastplates gritting\
Now enchant the old one's spirit.\
Martyr through times even in spells apt,\
When stone in depth, when falcon in air.

Even if its soul is free,\
[Still] it stays on the crest of tall mountains.\
With its hands it reaches up into the sky,\
While it clouds move in accordance with its song.

In runes, if you know [how], you can discern\
The proud age which sat [dormant] to come.\
There are mountains, forests, waters and clouds.\
In a century I will [also] be the old one.
