# Tapae

Come with the soul out onto the sun,\
Let your blood flow to the ground.\
Come with the crown to the valleys\
Look, a lament, look, a lament crooning.

The most brave in battle,\
Look at the world how they break,\
Leaving the fair-skinned mother\
And those dragons with the head of a wolf.

From the mist of ages\
And ancient blood,\
And citadel in the mountains,\
Which guard my heart.

Valour and bravery shine,\
Dacia's sons,\
Fearful in fury,\
Undying watchmen.

Enemies from the south,\
By zeal driven,\
By iron spikes and claws\
Will fall, lacerated.

And [those] legions of yours,\
I will send them to heaven.\
I will crush you, Traian,\
At the Iron Gate.

And a mess we'll leave them\
Tossing ourselves into manure.\
Craniums and entrails\
Made into bait

But your demigods,\
Which make the clouds scream,\
The foul-mouthed, warmonger flame,\
Shall cut down my sons.

Enemies from the south,\
By zeal driven,\
By iron spikes and claws,\
Will fall lacerated.

And [those] legions of yours,\
I will send them to heaven.\
I will crush you Traian,\
At the Iron Gate.
