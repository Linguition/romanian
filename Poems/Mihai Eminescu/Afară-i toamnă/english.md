# It's autumn outside

It's autumn outside, leaf scattered,\
While the wind flicks hard drops onto the windows;\
And you read letters from threadbare envelopes\
And for a while you think about life as a whole.

Losing yourself within sweet nothings,\
You would not like anyone at your door knocking;\
But even better would be, when the outside is sleety,\
To remain dreaming of fire, dozing off into sleep.

Besides, this way I look out from my train of thought,\
I dream of the fairy tale of Old Dokia,\
Around me the fog grows step by step;

Suddenly I hear the rustling of a dress,\
A soft step barely touched by planks...\
Whilst thin and cold hands cover my eyes.
