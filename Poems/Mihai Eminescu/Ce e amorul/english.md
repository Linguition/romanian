# What is love?

What is love? It's a lasting\
Opportunity for pain,\
Because a thousand tears are not enough\
And still it demands more.

Until a sign briefly from her\
It ties up your soul,\
So you can no longer forget her\
[For] your entire life.

But still if it waits for you on your doorstep\
In the shadow in the nooks,\
If beloved meets beloved\
Like your heart begs:

The skies and soil disappear\
And your chest hammers,\
And everything hangs on one word\
Half-whispered.

It follows you (for) weeks\
A step committed lazily,\
A sweet squeeze of hands,\
A tremor of eyelashes.

Illuminators follow you\
Like the Sun and Moon,\
And throughout the day so many times\
And the night endless.

For written it was that your life\
Not escape from missing her,\
For it engulfed you alike\
Water vines.
