# So delicate...

So delicate, you resemble\
A white cherry flower,\
And like an angel amongst people,\
On my life's road you emerge.

Barely touching the soft carpet,\
The silk sounds underfoot,\
And from the crown of head to bottom of toe\
You float like a sound dream.

From the folds of your long dress\
You were beaming like marble in place â€“\
My soul hangs on to the eyes\
Full of tears and fortune.

Oh, happy dream of love,\
Gentle bride from the stories,\
Smile no more! Your smiling\
Shows me how sweet you are,

How much can you with a charm's night\
Cloud my eyes for centuries,\
With your mouth's warm whispers,\
With hugs of cold arms.

Suddenly crosses a thought,\
A veil over your fiery eyes:\
It's the gloomy abandonment,\
It's the shadow of sweet desires.

You leave, and I've understood too well\
To not stay on your path,\
Lost for me for always,\
The bride of my soul!

That I have glimpsed you it is my fault\
And evermore I will not forgive myself,\
I will atone for the dream of light\
Tending to my right desolately.

You will beam like an icon\
Of eternally virgin Mary,\
On your head wearing a crown -\
Where are you going? When will you come?
