# What do I wish you, sweet Romania

What do I wish you, sweet Romania,\
My country of glory, my country of longing?\
Fidgety arms, strong weapons,\
In your great past, great future!\
May the wine boil in cups, may the goblet foam,\
If your proud sons nourish them with this;\
For the stone remains, but the surge diminishes,\
Sweet Romania, this is what I wish you.

A dream of revenge black as a grave\
Your sword fuming with foe blood,\
And above the hydra with the wind flutters\
Your dream of glory imposingly triumphing,\
May it tell the wide world tricoloured flags,\
May it announce what the great nation is, Romanian,\
When their sacred, candid blaze flares up\
Sweet Romania, this is what I wish you.

The angel of love, the angel of peace,\
Secretly smiling at the altar of Vesta,\
That on Mars in glory it blinds it,\
When with its lamp it flies illuminating the world,\
He onto your breast again will yet descend,\
May he taste the happiness of heaven, I wish,\
Squeeze him in your arms, raise altars for him,\
Sweet Romania, this is what I wish you.

What do I wish you, sweet Romania,\
Young bride, mother with love!\
May your sons live only in brotherhood\
Like the stars of night, like the dawns of day,\
Life for ages, glory, joy,\
Strong weapons, the Romanian soul,\
Dream of valour, pride and dare,\
Sweet Romania, this is what I wish you!
