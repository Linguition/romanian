# The love of a marble

The armies drive them away in frigid fear,\
With the soul in ruins, an Assyrian king,\
How its frothy pain throws to the stones,\
The groaning storm.

Why am I not a king to crush with my pain,\
Why am I not Satan, why am I not God?\
To destroy a world that tears in silence,\
My shattered soul.

A desert's lion bellows his rage, running,\
An ocean inebriates itself on the winds' game,\
And the clouds tell their bellowing pain in thunder,\
The thoughts of fire.

I don't have anyone to share my atrocious pain with,\
I don't have anyone to share my crazy adoration with,\
Since _to me_ fate has given the sour solace\
A stone to love.

To the dying one - hope, to the madness - revenge,\
To the prophet - curse, to God - faith,\
A shadow at the suicide which hopes for its disappearance,\
Nothing, nought me.

Nought, only the image of you which embitters me,\
Nothing, only the souvenir of your smooth grin,\
Nothing but a ray from your serene face,\
From your serene eye.

I love you too, child, as the quick June\
Loves in eyes of flames the luck of days,\
I love as a strong gust of wind loves a whirlwind,\
An ocean of fire.

From the eyes if would sip genius my weakened sight,\
If your delicate heart would tremble at my breast,\
You would put on my forehead in dreams of greatness\
A diadem of fire.

And I would put the fortune of the world on your cardinal face,\
I would make law to the world your laughing delirium,\
I would make your smile a century of orgy,\
And your tears chrism.

For I love you, child, like a god does immortality,\
Like a priest does an altar, like funk does an asylum;\
Like a sceptre does a meek hand, like a does vulture power,\
Like a dream does a child

And the step in your wake flies off like a secret ire,\
Like a maniac that hunts with a yellowed eye,\
With a bruised brow, with an ash-gray face,\
The image that he loved.
