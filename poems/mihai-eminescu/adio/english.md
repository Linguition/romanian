Adieu
=====

From now on I ought not see you,  
Fare, fare, -well!  
On my path, I will keep clear  
Of you.

As of today do but what you will,  
As of today it will no longer bother me  
That the sweetest woman of all  
Is leaving me.

Since I no longer have the habit  
As ere in those days,  
Of inebriating myself too until the spark  
Of stars,

When frostbitten so many times,  
I was looking through the branches  
And waiting for you to appear  
At the window.

Oh how jolly was I  
Of us walking together,  
Under this calm charm  
Of the Moon.

And when in secret I prayed  
For the night in place to stay,  
For ages to have you beside me,  
Woman!

From their passing that I bring  
Those sweet words,  
Of which today I barely have  
A memory.

As today if I listen still  
To these trifles,  
It seems an old, from a time bygone,  
Story.

And if the moon shines on meadows  
And shakes the lakes,  
It all but seems to me that since then,  
There have been centuries.

With the eyes of the former night  
I will no longer watch her...  
That is why in my wake you shall remain -  
Adieu!
